Xiangshi is a text similarity calculator specially designed for Chinese. This is the only and the best Chinese text similarity calculator

The advantages of Xiangshi are:

  - Focus on Chinese text similarity comparison
  - Cosine calculation and simhash algorithm are used
  - 100% Python language
  - Automatic TFIDF filtering
  - TF and IDF can be calculated separately
  - List and file are supported
  - Support multiple file similarity comparison
  - Efficient and quick
  - Easy to install
  - 100% open source
  - Long term maintenance and renewal

### Download and install
PIP installation:
```sh
$ pip3 install xiangshi
```
If it is slow in China, you can use Tsinghua image:
```sh
$ pip3 install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple xiangshi
```

### Usage method
#### Calculate text similarity
##### Cosine similarity
```py
import xiangshi as xs
xs.cossim (Input1, Input2)
```
##### Simhash & Minhash similarity
```py
import xiangshi as xs
# Simhash
xs.simhash (Input1, Input2)
# Minhash
xs.minhash (Input1, Input2)
```
  - When calculating the text similarity, it is automatically filtered by TFIDF
  - Input1 - the first input value, which can be the address of a file or a list
  - Input2 - the second input value, which can be the address of a file or a list

##### Calculate TF, IDF, TFIDF
```py
import xiangshi as xs
xs.GetTF (Input)
xs.GetIDF (Input)
xs.GetTFIDF ï¼ˆInput)
```
  - Input - input value, which can be the address of a file or a list
  - Input type for calculating text similarity
  - At present, two types of acquaintance are supported: file and list file
